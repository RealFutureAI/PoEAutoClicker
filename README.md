# PoEAutoClicker
A fast AHK tool to release beasts from your bestiary by continously pressing ctrl+leftclick

Instructions:

1. Install Autohotkey
2. Download PoEAutoClicker.ahk and run it
3. In PoE: open your bestiary, type in the regex to filter which beasts should be released, hover over the x on the top left corner beast and press alt+q once. To stop the program simply press escape.

Careful! The tool will not filter the beasts for you, you have to do that on your own or it will release valuable beasts too!
